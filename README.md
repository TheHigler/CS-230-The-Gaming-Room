# CS-230-The-Gaming-Room

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room had an existing android game called Draw it or Lose it where the teams compete to guess the picture being drawn. The Gaming Room wants to expand their existing game to multiple platforms utilizing different software patterns in a distributive enviornment. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel I did particularly well outlining the different aspects surrounding the different requirements needed to implement what The Gaming Room wanted to accomplish in a clear manner. I do feel that I could have went into further detail in some of the elements of the documentation. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

The document is a great way to stay on track and make sure you think about and cover all the different aspects that will surround the project. It would be very easy to overlook a requirement that could set the project back or create unnecessary road blocks when developing the application. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I was pretty brief in the earlier elements of the document and didn't quite emplore proper constraints surrounding the project. On the subject of constraints I would explore things such as software memory requirements that may exceed the current machine specifications or perhaps a certain format that may be supported by some off the shelf applications. I would go into more detail surrounding more speicifc requirements such as vidoe formats and outputs.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The user is essentially the customer so, it's important to take their needs into consideration to ensure a happy userbase. If a users needs aren't met, we won't see user retention and potentially end up with a failing product. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I looked at all the different aspects we would encounter designing the software to ensure a smooth implementation that meets the users and clients needs. This was mostly handled through proper and thorough documentation. In the future I would concentrate on more thorough and concise documentation. This will ensure the users needs are properly met despite how many constraints they may have.
